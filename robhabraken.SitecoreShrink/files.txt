List of files that should be included in this module, but are not present in this namespace / project:
- sitecore modules/Shell/robhabraken/SitecoreShrink/. (this folder may be unnecessary and seems to be deprecated, check and remove if applicable)
- sitecore/shell/client/YourApps/SitecoreShrink/.
- Web.config now contains some custom settings, these should be moved to own config file!

Items:
- core/sitecore/client/Your Apps/SitecoreShrink/.

Texts / advise
- Archive data that you want to keep (for example, for audit purposes); recycle data that you may want to restore; delete data that you want to remove. For optimal performance and usability, recycle or remove as much data as you can, and archive whatever else you do not need in the Master database.

- mind that you need to publish the media library after archiving, recycling or deleting items.

THIS SHIZZLE BELOW MAY BE REDUNDANT OR UNNECESSARY, BECAUSE CLEANING UP ORPHANS IN A DATABASE IS ALREADY POSSIBLE WITH SITECORE AND THE CODE BELOW TAKES WAY TO LONG TO EXECUTE
AND ALSO REQUIRES SOME SPECIFIC USER RIGHTS, SO I MIGHT RETARGET MY MODULE TOWARDS MANAGING DATA USAGE IN THE MEDIA LIBRARY AND CLEANING UP CONTENT IN GENERAL

Texts / advise
- advise to run orphan clean up after deleting items but before archiving or recycling, thus also warn that orphan method invalidates recycled items

Ideas:
- You now have 2951 MB of unallocated space, you might want to shrink your database files to release this unused space. (Display if more than 500 MB)
- You will need db_owner rights (?) for this operation. Please login with your admin account first or skip this step if you gave your site account this permission (note that this is not recommended).
