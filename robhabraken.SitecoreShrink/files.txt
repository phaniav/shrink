List of files (and items) that should be included in this module, but are not present in this namespace / project:
- App_Config/Include/Shrink/.


Remarks:
- auto publish after clean up? Or should I make this optional? it is needed for archived, recycled and deleted items 
- Archive data that you want to keep (for example, for audit purposes); recycle data that you may want to restore; delete data that you want to remove. For optimal performance and usability, recycle or remove as much data as you can, and archive whatever else you do not need in the Master database.

- advise to run orphan clean up after deleting items but before archiving or recycling, thus also warn that orphan method invalidates recycled items
- test on large databases and see if I need to make a few operations scheduled tasks


Ideas:
- You now have 2951 MB of unallocated space, you might want to shrink your database files to release this unused space. (Display if more than 500 MB)
- You will need db_owner rights (?) for this operation. Please login with your admin account first or skip this step if you gave your site account this permission (note that this is not recommended).
