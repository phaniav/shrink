# Sitecore Shrink
A Sitecore module that helps you out with all size and performance optimization related tasks, concentrated on the database size of the media library for the first release.

Note: This repository will be moved to a public one (Open Source) as soon as the first release is finished and once the article is published. In the meantime, the work will be done in my own fork of this repository.



**_Please note that this module is rather new and only tested on a small number of databases and Sitecore instances. Please backup your original database before using this module and preferably test the module for your situation on any other than your production environemnt , to make sure no data is lost._**
